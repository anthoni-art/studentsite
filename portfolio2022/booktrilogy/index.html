            <h1>Book Trilogy</h1>
            <h3 class="subheader">As David Sedaris would say, “become a
                great observer.”</h3>

                <div class="two-thirds column">
                    <p>In this project, I was assigned to create three book covers for a trilogy. I chose stories by David
                        Sedaris, an author who loves to share some of his life stories with a hint of humor. In the process
                        of creating the book covers, I first sketched many different cover ideas for one of his stories. After
                        choosing one idea, I used different types of mediums to create three separate looks. After a class
                        vote on which medium was best, I created two more book covers in the same style to finalize the
                        trilogy.
                        The idea for A Modest Proposal, was behind David’s relationship between him and his boyfriend
                        getting married. He didn’t believe in marriage so to communicate that I illustrated a cake topper on
                        top of a stack of paper representing what marriage actually takes.
                        In Loggerheads, it told a time when David took some sea turtles home as a kid and they died in
                        his tank. The story also had a deeper meaning of his neglected childhood which I used for
                        inspiration in my design.
                        The design for Untamed was pretty direct, except there was no humanoid fox. The story was
                        about David Sedaris befriending a wild fox in his backyard that he named Carol. The design sheds
                        light on David’s humor and perception of the fox.</p>
