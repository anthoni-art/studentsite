            <h3 class="subheader">A fresh and clean redesign for a
                sanitization company. May your site take
                on a refreshing look with purpose.</h3>

                <div class="two-thirds column">
                    <p>For this project, I was allowed to redesign any website of my choice. At the time, I was
                        employed at Hiro Systems Hawaii and noticed their site had a lot of text but not much going
                        for it. I imagined it could have a strong fresh feel so I chose to redesign it. I started off by
                        drafting a site map, 2 style tiles, and 3 wireframes. After the drafting phase, I began collecting
                        graphic assets. Luckily I was able to get a hold of their logo and product images from prior
                        work projects, but the most difficult task was finding royalty-free images that aligned with my
                        low-budget. After some compromises and photoshop skills for the images, I made 3 different
                        conceptual designs of the site. My main focus was to create a design that felt more engaging
                        with the audience by using imagery that could tell a story. I've also adjusted a lot of the
                        typography while still keeping the same typefaces to follow their brand style guide. The final
                        design was decided by the class but was later revised again for further improvement. Here is
                        the final design.</p>
