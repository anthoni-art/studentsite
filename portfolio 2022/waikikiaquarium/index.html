                    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I loved animals and visiting the Waikiki Aquarium. As someone whoâ€™d
                        dreamt of working in the creative industry, I never imagined getting to work at the aquarium.
                        Throughout the internship, I learned valuable skills that could help me in my career, such as
                        communication with others for big scaled projects and managing multiple tasks on my own.

                        One of the bigger projects I had was to design a Thanksgiving fundraiser. For that project, I had to
                        create an illustration of three different sized narwhals that could be cut out. Then I created posters
                        and tv displays for the campaign. The cut outs ranged in prices from one to five dollars and the
                        fundraiser generated nearly one thousand dollars just after three to four weeks.

                        Other projects at the aquarium involved creating signage for events and graphics for different
                        types of media.</p>
